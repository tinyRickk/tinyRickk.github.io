# Plain-Academic Template
A truly simple website template for academics. It was developed with simplicity in mind (both in terms of style and in code complexity).

Just download the two files (index.html and photo.gif) and start editing straightaway.

# How To

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Open the **Plain-Academic Template** repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner to create your own copy.

### Step 2: Edit Directly on GitHub
1. Open the `index.html` file in your forked repository.
2. Click the pencil icon (✏️) to edit the file.
3. Replace the placeholder text with your own details:
   - Update your name, contact information, and academic details.
   - Add your own links to papers, projects, or CV.

### Step 3: Replace the Profile Picture
1. Upload your own profile picture:
   - Click **Add file** → **Upload files** in your repository.
   - Ensure your picture is named `photo.gif` (so it replaces the existing one).

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository’s **Settings**.
2. Scroll down to the **Pages** section.
3. In the "Source" dropdown, select the `main` branch and click **Save**.
4. Your website will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

### Editing Locally (Optional)
If you prefer to work locally instead of editing directly on GitHub:
1. Clone your forked repository:
   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
    ```

2. Open the files in a text editor like VS Code.

3. After making changes, push them back to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated my website"
git push
```
